## **Practical Examples**
### numerical
- Check numeric value
	Write a program that checks the numeric values ​​in a list and only displays values ​​greater than 20.
- Find average in a List
	Write a program that checks the numeric values ​​in a list and find average.
- Fizzbuzz_asd
	Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 100
	For each number in this range:
	- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
	- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
	- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
	- Else, print the number itself
- Fizzbuzz_des
	Uses a for loop to iterate from 100 to 1
	For each number in this range:
	- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
	- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
	- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
	- Else, print the number itself
- Calculator
	The program takes two user inputs and performs addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, then prints the results if input value not equal 40
	```shell
	$> python3 calculator.py
	Give me the first number: 2 
	Give me the second number: 2
	2 + 2 = 4
	2 - 2 = 0
	2 / 2 = 1
	2 * 2 = 4
	```
### string
- **Count character**
	Write a program that checks the string and count `c` in string
	**Given**:
	```
		txts = "cat"
		char_to_count = "c"
	```
	**Output**:
	```
	The character c appears 1 times in the string cat.
	```
- **Find string in list**
	Write a program that checks the string ​​in a list and displays `Found` is string equal `green`.
		**Given**:
	```
		lsts = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
	```
	**Output**:
	```
	found
	```

### dict



### list
- **Append data**
	Take `n` inputs from the user and store them in a list
	**Input**
	```
	$> Enter your number : 3
	Enter string : Hello
	Enter string : world
	Enter string : end
	```
	**Output**
	```
	['Hello', 'world', 'end']
	```
- **Print and Sum data**
	Write a Python program that displays a list of items along with their corresponding prices, and calculates the total cost of all items.
	**Given**:
	```
		items = ["apple", "banana", "milk", "bread"]
		prices = [10, 5, 20, 15]
	```
	**Output**:
	```
		apple: 10 baht
		banana: 5 baht
		milk: 20 baht
		bread: 15 baht

		Total: 50 baht
	```
