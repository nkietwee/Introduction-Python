## **Practical Examples**
### numerical
- Check numeric value
	Write a program that checks the numeric values ​​in a list and only displays values ​​greater than 20.
- Find average in a List
	Write a program that checks the numeric values ​​in a list and find average.
- Fizzbuzz_asd
	Uses a for loop to iterate from 1 to 100
	For each number in this range:
	- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
	- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
	- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
	- Else, print the number itself
- Fizzbuzz_des
	Uses a for loop to iterate from 100 to 1
	For each number in this range:
	- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
	- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz"
	- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz"
	- Else, print the number itself
- Calculator
	The program takes two user inputs and performs addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication, then prints the results if input value not equal 40
	```shell
	$> python3 calculator.py
	Give me the first number: 2 
	Give me the second number: 2
	2 + 2 = 4
	2 - 2 = 0
	2 / 2 = 1
	2 * 2 = 4
	```
### string
- Count character
	Write a program that checks the string and count `c` in string

- Find string in list
	Write a program that checks the string ​​in a list and displays `Found` is string equal `green`.

### dict



### list
- Append data
	Take n inputs from the user and store them in a list
- Print and Sum data
	Write a Python program that displays a list of items along with their corresponding prices, and calculates the total cost of all items.
	Given:
		items = ["apple", "banana", "milk", "bread"]
		prices = [10, 5, 20, 15]

	Output:
		Each item with its price in the format: item: price baht
		The total cost of all items in the format: Total: total baht
